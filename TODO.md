# Ergonomics API Implementation TODO

## âœ… Completed Steps
- [x] Project exploration and planning
- [x] User confirmation received

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Data Models & Types âœ…
- [x] Create TypeScript types for ergonomics domain
- [x] Define data models and interfaces
- [x] Set up utility functions and calculations

### Phase 2: Backend API Development âœ…
- [x] Create assessments API endpoint
- [x] Create risk analysis API endpoint
- [x] Create recommendations API endpoint (with AI integration)
- [x] Create health metrics API endpoint
- [x] Create equipment database API endpoint
- [x] Create reports generation API endpoint

### Phase 3: Frontend Components
- [ ] Create main landing page
- [ ] Create dashboard page with metrics overview
- [ ] Create assessment form components
- [ ] Create recommendations display components
- [ ] Create equipment catalog components
- [ ] Create progress tracking components

### Phase 4: Data & Configuration
- [ ] Set up equipment database
- [ ] Create assessment templates
- [ ] Configure ergonomic calculation algorithms

### Phase 5: Testing & Integration
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Build application (`pnpm run build --no-lint`)
- [ ] Start server (`pnpm start`)
- [ ] API testing with curl commands
- [ ] Frontend functionality testing
- [ ] Integration testing

### Phase 6: Final Polish
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Responsive design verification
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation and README update

## Current Status: Starting Phase 1
